MVC Tutorial Contoso Universtiy found here: http://www.asp.net/mvc/overview/getting-started/getting-started-with-ef-using-mvc/creating-an-entity-framework-data-model-for-an-asp-net-mvc-application

This is the 3rd MVC tutorial that I've done. It seems to be an intermediate level tutorial. I decided to comment the heck out of the code this time so I can come back to this application when I built my own websites.
